1. DEAL SIZE MATTERS:
   - SBA prequalification is more common in $1-2M range (optimal for SBA)
   - Smaller deals (<$500K) rarely use SBA even if eligible
   - Commission differences are due to deal size, not financing type

2. CONTROLLED COMPARISON ($500K-2M deals):
   - Time differences persist: SBA adds ~38 days
   - Success rates remain higher for SBA-eligible
   - Inquiry counts similar when controlling for size

3. WITHIN SBA-ELIGIBLE DEALS:
   - Only 43% actually use SBA financing
   - Those using SBA close FASTER than those who don't (-54 days)
   - Suggests SBA buyers are more committed/prepared

4. BROKER ECONOMICS:
   - SBA focus: 1.49 successful deals/year per slot
   - Non-SBA focus: 1.60 successful deals/year per slot
   - Non-SBA slightly better throughput despite lower success rate

5. TRUE TRADE-OFFS:
   - NOT about commission (stays same)
   - IS about: certainty vs speed
   - 38-day wait costs seller $6-20K in opportunity (at 5-15% returns)
   - Cash buyers often demand 3-5% discount ($45-75K on $1.5M deal)
