# The Benefits and Drawbacks of SBA Transactions

## Summary
Everyone knows SBA deals take longer and get more interest. But our analysis of 531 listings reveals some surprising patterns that can help advisors make smarter decisions about when and how to use SBA pre-qualification.

The data shows SBA pre-qualification increases your success rate by 13.2%, attracts 42% more inquiries, but adds 60 days to your timeline. Here's the twist: only 28% of SBA pre-qualified deals actually use SBA financing. The other 72% leverage that buyer interest to close with faster alternatives.

## The Real Success Rate Impact

SBA pre-qualification moves your success rate from 61% to 74%. That's not just a feel-good statistic—it translates directly to your bottom line.

Key findings:
• **74.5% of SBA pre-qualified deals close** vs 61.3% for non-SBA deals
• To close 100 deals, you need 134 SBA listings or 163 non-SBA listings
• That's 29 fewer listings to manage for the same revenue
• Sample size: 76 SBA deals sold, 263 non-SBA deals sold

## How SBA Affects Your Annual Deal Flow

The 60-day delay isn't just a number—it directly impacts how many deals you can handle per year. If you're running at capacity, this matters.

Timeline breakdown:
• **Non-SBA deals:** 178 days average (106 days to LOI, 72 days to close)
• **SBA deals:** 238 days average (142 days to LOI, 96 days to close)
• **The delay happens everywhere:** Both getting to LOI (+36 days) and closing (+24 days) take longer
• **Annual capacity impact:** If you handle 10 deals/year, adding 2 SBA deals reduces capacity by 0.67 deals

The math on opportunity cost:
• Commission deferred per SBA deal: $31,156 (assuming $2M deal, 9.5% commission)
• Net cost for 2 SBA deals in a 10-deal portfolio: -$12,134
• This assumes you're at capacity—if not, SBA deals are pure upside

## The 42% Inquiry Boost Nobody Talks About

Including "SBA" in your listing title generates 42% more buyer inquiries. Yet 17% of our SBA pre-qualified deals don't mention it in the title.

The numbers:
• **Listings with "SBA" in title:** 429 average inquiries
• **Listings without "SBA":** 301 average inquiries
• **Success rate with "SBA" in title:** 79.5%
• **Success rate without:** 60.9%

This isn't just about more leads—it's about attracting serious buyers who understand financing. The title acts as a pre-qualification filter.

## The Secret: Using SBA to Attract Cash Buyers

Here's what the data revealed: 72% of SBA pre-qualified deals closed with alternative financing, not SBA loans. These advisors used SBA as leverage.

How it works:
• **21 deals actually used SBA financing** (265 days average to close)
• **55 deals used alternative financing** (224 days average to close)
• **Time saved by switching:** 41 days
• **Why it happens:** Competition from SBA-qualified buyers pushes cash buyers to move faster

Common alternative financing used:
• Cash purchases
• Traditional bank loans
• Seller financing
• Private equity

The pattern is clear: advertise SBA to attract buyers, then let competition drive better offers.

## When SBA Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)

The data suggests specific scenarios where SBA pre-qualification adds the most value.

Use SBA pre-qualification when:
• You're not at capacity (no opportunity cost)
• The business needs the credibility boost
• You expect a competitive bidding situation
• The ideal buyer is likely a first-timer

Skip SBA pre-qualification when:
• You have strong cash buyer interest already
• Speed is critical (business declining, seller urgency)
• You're at capacity with other deals
• The business won't pass SBA requirements anyway

## Hidden Risks in the Extended Timeline

The extra 60 days isn't just about opportunity cost. More time means more chances for problems.

What can go wrong in those extra days:
• Business performance changes (especially seasonal businesses)
• Buyer gets cold feet or finds another opportunity
• Key employees leave
• Major customer loss
• Market conditions shift
• Seller fatigue sets in

One advisor noted: "The deal you close in 90 days is worth two that might close in 240 days."
