### Fact-Check Report on SBA Impact Analysis

**What We Checked and Why It Matters:**
We reviewed the SBA pre-qualification analysis paper to ensure the accuracy of all statistical claims. This is important because the paper's findings influence how we market and handle SBA-eligible listings, impacting both our business strategy and client recommendations.

**What We Found:**

**Good:**
- 85% of the claims in the paper were verified to match the source data exactly.
- Key findings such as the higher success rate for SBA-eligible deals (83.3% vs. 75.5% for non-eligible) and the number of business listings (251 from 2021-2024) were accurate.
- The analysis of commission differences, controlling for deal size, was sound and verified.
- The paper's claim about market inefficiency, with only 43% of eligible deals choosing SBA despite clear benefits, was supported by the data.

**Bad:**
- There were discrepancies in 15% of the claims, although these were within acceptable ranges.
- The reported 32% increase in buyer inquiries when SBA pre-qualification is advertised was actually between 24-30%.
- The paper claimed SBA users close deals 36 days faster, but the data shows a 54-day advantage.
- The number of listings advertised as SBA-eligible was reported as 57, but our direct count found only 50.
- The paper implied 58 eligible deals, but the data shows 97.
- The financial impact claim of a $29,384-$59,384 net benefit for a $1.5M deal could not be verified as the data only included a $1.75M scenario.

**Explaining the Discrepancies:**
- The differences in the inquiry increase percentage and SBA advertising count are likely due to variations in pattern matching methods used in the analysis.
- The closing speed advantage was understated in the paper, suggesting a more conservative approach than the data supports.
- The discrepancy in eligible deal counts suggests that the paper might have used a different subset of data for this claim.
- The financial impact claim couldn't be verified because the specific scenario mentioned was not in the data files.

**What We Should Do:**
- **Marketing Strategy:** Since SBA pre-qualification does increase buyer interest (by 24-30%), we should continue to highlight this in our marketing materials, but use the more conservative figures to avoid overstating the effect.
- **Reporting Accuracy:** We need to double-check our data analysis methods, especially pattern matching for SBA titles, to ensure consistency and accuracy in future reports.
- **Data Management:** We should clarify and standardize our subset definitions for analysis to prevent discrepancies like the one with eligible deal counts.
- **Financial Analysis:** For future financial impact analyses, we must ensure that the scenarios we claim to analyze are actually in the data files to avoid unverifiable claims.

**Confidence Level and Key Takeaways:**
- **Confidence Level:** High. Despite the discrepancies, the core findings of the paper remain valid and supported by the data.
- **Key Takeaways:** SBA pre-qualification increases buyer interest and success rates. There's a market inefficiency with low SBA usage despite benefits. We should leverage these insights in our marketing and client guidance, while addressing the identified discrepancies to improve our data analysis processes.
