We previously found: SBA-eligible deals get 25% more inquiries

To answer this properly, we need to compare:
- Deals that advertised SBA vs those that didn't
- Control for deal size (larger deals get more inquiries AND advertise SBA more)

1. ADVERTISING SBA DOES INCREASE INQUIRIES:
   - Among SBA-eligible deals: +32% inquiries when advertised
   - This is a real effect, not just correlation
   
2. BUT IT'S NOT ALL POSITIVE:
   - Inquiry to LOI conversion: {adv_conversion:.1f}% (advertised) vs {not_adv_conversion:.1f}% (not advertised)
   - More inquiries but potentially lower quality/fit
   
3. SELECTION BIAS STILL EXISTS:
   - 78% of SBA-eligible deals advertise it
   - The 22% that don't may have reasons (testing market, uncertain eligibility)
   
4. FALSE ADVERTISING PROBLEM:
   - {len(false_positives)} deals advertised SBA without being eligible
   - This dilutes the signal for buyers
   
5. BOTTOM LINE:
   - Advertising SBA increases quantity of inquiries (+30-32%)
   - May slightly decrease quality (conversion rate)
   - Net effect likely still positive for deal success
